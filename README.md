**Abstract**

So-called "classification trimmed likelihood curves" have been proposed as a heuristic
tool to determine the number of clusters and trimming proportion in trimmingbased
robust clustering methods. However, these curves needs a careful visual inspection,
and this way of choosing parameters requires subjective decisions. This work is
intended to provide theoretical background for the understanding of these curves and
the elements involved in their derivation. Moreover, a parametric bootstrap approach
is presented in order to automatize the choice of parameter more by providing a reduced
list of "sensible" choices for the parameters. The user can then pick a solution
that fits their aims from that reduced list..
